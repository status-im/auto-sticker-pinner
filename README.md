# Description

This is an automation written in Python for pinning Status Sticker Packs to our IPFS cluster.

In simple terms it talks to a [`go-ethereum`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) node over RPC and waits for specific Ethereum Contract events to detect new Sticker Packs being added. When it detects such an event it talks to the IPFS cluster to pin the pack metadata and all the images.
